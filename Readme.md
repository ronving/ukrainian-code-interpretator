# Ukrainian Code Interpretator

A little fun pet project with the purpose to code in the Ukrainian language.

## Installation

Just execute **Main.java** file and have fun ^)

## Usage

Write simple programs in code.txt using basics, like:

```java
if                   - якщо
else                 - або
System.out.println   - вивести
var a = "something"; - a = "something"
```
everything else is exactly the same as in Java
